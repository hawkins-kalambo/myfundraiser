      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        My name is <strong>Hawkins Kalambo</strong>, and I have been selected to study 
        a <em>Bachelor of Science (Honors) in Renewable Energy Systems Engineering</em> 
        at <strong>Mzuzu University</strong>, Malawi.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Back in 2015, I completed my MSCE with 15 points. Since then, I have applied 
        to various institutions, but was not considered. Despite setbacks, I never gave up. 
        Education has always been my key to change my life and contribute to my community.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Now, after years of perseverance, I finally have this opportunity. 
        My tuition fee is MK 2,006,371 per year, and I must pay half 
        (about MK 1,000,000) by <strong>29th September 2025</strong> to register.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        I humbly seek your support to reach this goal. Every contribution, 
        big or small, will bring me closer to achieving my dream 
        and contributing to renewable energy solutions in Malawi.
